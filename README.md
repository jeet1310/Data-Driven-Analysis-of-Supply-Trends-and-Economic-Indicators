# 📊 Data-Driven Analysis of Supply Trends and Economic Indicators

## 🧾 Project Summary

This Tableau project analyzes supply chain dynamics and economic activity using data-driven insights from e-way bills, asset values, and COVID-era disruptions. It focuses on the Indian state of **Meghalaya**, tracking supply flows, asset fluctuations, and logistical trends from **2018 to 2024**.

The dashboards are designed to support economic decision-making and policy evaluation, particularly around the COVID-19 impact.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze the **annual and percentage composition** of different supply types.
- Track **value fluctuations** of assets over time.
- Measure **e-way bill** generation to assess logistics activity.
- Study the **impact of COVID-19** using daily economic indicators.
- Visualize trends using **interactive Tableau dashboards**.

## 📦 Dataset Description

The project uses a federated dataset consisting of:

- Supply type distribution (incoming/outgoing/within state)
- Asset value data (2018–2024)
- Daily activity indicators
- Number and value of e-way bills

Data was cleaned, formatted for time series analysis, and smoothed using **7-day moving averages** for volatile periods.

## 📊 Key Dashboards

- **Annual Supply Composition by Type**  
  Displays supply trends year-wise and the growth/decline of different supply types.

- **Supply-Type Percentage**  
  Visualizes the share of each supply type, aiding comparative analysis.

- **Daily Values vs. 7-Day Moving Average**  
  Highlights COVID-19’s effect by comparing raw and smoothed data.

- **Highest Value of Assets**  
  Identifies peak economic activity periods.

- **Value of Assets by Years**  
  Year-over-year changes in total asset values.

- **Number of E-Way Bills**  
  Acts as a proxy for logistics and transport trends.

- **COVID-19 Analysis**  
  Focuses on pandemic-era economic responses.

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Both supply volume and value increased over time, with a noticeable dip during COVID-19.
- Outgoing supplies consistently outpace incoming ones, showing a strong export trend.
- Some supply types (e.g., interstate outward) show high efficiency with fewer but higher-value transactions.
- Meghalaya’s supply chain rebounded quickly post-COVID, though it relies heavily on external inputs.

---

## ✅ Recommendations

- Policymakers should monitor supply trends for responsive governance.
- Businesses can use asset value trends to optimize resource planning.
- E-way bill tracking can serve as a near real-time economic indicator.
